# Pomodoro App
Pomodoro App is a web application that allows users to create study and learning sessions using the Pomodoro technique. The unique feature of this app is that users can log in and register using their Discord account, making the process quick and easy.

## Introduction

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. These intervals are known as "pomodoros." 

PomodoroApp is a simple and clean implementation of the Pomodoro Technique, helping you stay focused on tasks and manage your time effectively.


## Features
Some of the features of Pomodoro App include:

##### User authentication through Discord
##### Creating study and learning sessions

##### To get started with Pomodoro App, simply visit the website and sign in using your Discord account. Once you have logged in, you can create a new session by clicking the "Create Session" button on the home page. From there, you can customize the length of the session and the timer settings.
